Description   :   The program is an implementation of Vigen√®re cipher which is used to encode or decode any plain test with a code word.
                  The program provides three options to the users:
                  1. Encode
                  2. Decode
                  3. Exit
                  On choosing option one or two, the console asks for the name of the file to be encrypted/decrypted, the code word with
                  which the file needs to be encrypted/decrypted. The output is in a file generated in the same location as the input
                  file with an _e for encryption and _d for decryption appended to the input filename. After the file is generated the
                  program provides the options once again to the user. It doesnot exit until the user chooses to exit.
